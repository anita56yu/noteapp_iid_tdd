# 4. Review: 

This is the fourth step of IID. It uses the file docs/FEATURES.md.
    - Review the completed features and tasks in docs/FEATURES.md.  
    - Identified possible new features and tasks or revisions upon my confirmation.
    - Identify big refectoring that does not directly relate to the current task or feature. For example, addressing cross-cutting concerns such as preventing domain or repository layer leaking to the api layer. Consult docs/REFACTORING.md.
    - On my confirmation, we can go back to Step 1 (docs/ANALYSIS.md), Step 2 (docs/DESIGN.md), Step 3 (docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md), or declare completion of development.
