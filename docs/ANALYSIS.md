This is the first step on IID (Iterative and Incremental Development). It uses the file docs/FEATURES.md.
    - read **Problem statement** in docs/FEATURES.md.

    - maintain a features checklist as described in the file ./FEATURES.md.
    - when you're done with this step, on my confirmation, move on to the step '2. DESIGN:'
