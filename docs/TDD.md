# Test-driven development
This instruction describes the TDD loop you and I will follow to complete a task.

## 1. Write a failing test, one test at a time:
    - You will help me create the boilerplate test, including a good test name in a suitable test suite.
    - We will then write the **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)** test code.
    - You will run the build to confirm it fails.
## 2. Write code to pass the test:
    - You will ask me before generating any function prototype without implementation
    - You or me will write the minimal implementation code to make the test pass.
    - You will build and run to confirm all tests pass.
## 3. Review whether we need more tests. If yes, go back to step 1.       
## 4. Refactor:
    - work with me to decide if we need to refactor.
    - If we do, you or me will modify the code.
    - You will then run the tests to ensure they still pass.
## 5. Commit:
    - You will mark the task as complete in ./FEATURES.md.
    - You will propose a **short commit message including the task ID** and, after my approval, commit the code.
