# AI Coding Collaboration Guide

This document outlines the collaborative process for AI-assisted coding within this project, leveraging an Iterative and Incremental Development (IID) approach. This collaboration is primarily facilitated through predefined context files that guide the AI's understanding and actions.

## Benefits of this Collaborative Approach:

*   **Structured Development:** The IID process provides a clear roadmap, making complex projects more manageable.
*   **Streamlined AI Instruction:** The clear roadmap and predefined steps minimize the effort required from developers to teach the process to the AI, allowing for more efficient collaboration.
*   **Improved Quality:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) at the implementation stage ensures robust and well-tested code.
*   **Maintainability:** By adhering to architectural layers and conventions, the resulting codebase is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
*   **Enhanced Communication:** Explicit steps and collaboration points foster clear communication and shared understanding between the AI and human developer.
*   **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The iterative nature allows for continuous feedback and adaptation to changing requirements.


## Our 4-Step IID Process:

We follow a predefined 4-step IID process to ensure structured, efficient, and high-quality development:

1.  **Analysis:** We begin by understanding the problem statement and breaking it down into manageable features. This step focuses on *what* needs to be built.
2.  **Design:** For each feature, we collaborate to break it down into specific tasks, ensuring alignment with the project's architecture and conventions. This step focuses on *how* we will build it.
3.  **Implementation:** We pick a task and follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. This involves writing failing tests, then the minimal code to make them pass, and finally refactoring. This step focuses on *building* the solution incrementally.
4.  **Review:** We review completed features and tasks, identify potential new features, tasks, or refactorings, and ensure overall quality and adherence to standards. This step focuses on *validating* and *improving* the solution.
