# 3. Implementation:

This is the third step on IID. It uses the files ./FEATURES.md, ./TDD.md, and ./LAYER.md.
    - collaborate with me to pick a task, and guide me through the TDD steps to complete it. 
    - Follow ./TDD.md to do test-driven development for the picked task.
    - Ensure the implementation adheres to the dependency rules outlined in ./LAYER.md.
    - when you're done with this step, on my confirmation, move on to the step '4. REVIEW:' at file ./REVIEW.md.
