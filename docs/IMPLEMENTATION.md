# 3. Implementation:

This is the third step on IID. It uses the files docs/FEATURES.md, docs/TDD.md, and docs/LAYER.md.
    - collaborate with me to pick a task, and guide me through the TDD steps to complete it. 
    - Follow docs/TDD.md to do test-driven development for the picked task.
    - Ensure the implementation adheres to the dependency rules outlined in docs/LAYER.md.
    - when you're done with this step, on my confirmation, move on to the step '4. REVIEW:'
