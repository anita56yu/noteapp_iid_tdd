# VS Code Extension Development Guide

This document outlines the process we will follow to develop the Note App VS Code extension. For each task, I will first explain the design and implementation details before generating any code. This will ensure you understand the purpose of each code change and how it fits into the overall extension.

## Development Process

We will follow a structured approach to implement each feature:

1.  **Task Selection:** We will select a task from the `FEATURES.md` file.
2.  **Design and Implementation Explanation:** I will provide a detailed explanation of the task, including:
    *   **Goal:** What we are trying to achieve with this task.
    *   **VS Code API:** Which VS Code APIs we will use and why.
    *   **Code Structure:** How the new code will be organized and interact with existing code.
    *   **User Experience:** How the changes will affect the user interface and interaction.
    *   **Unit Testing:** According to the goal, write and explain unit tests first.
3.  **Code Generation:** Once you approve the design, I will generate the necessary code.
4.  **Testing:** I will guide you on how to manually test the new functionality in the Extension Development Host window.
5.  **Review and Refinement:** We will review the changes and make any necessary adjustments.

This process will ensure that you are always in control of the development process and have a clear understanding of the extension's architecture.
